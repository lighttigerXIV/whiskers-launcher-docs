# Building

After making the code for the extension you can do the following steps:

Inside your src folder:
- Build extension. `cargo build --relase`
- Copy the release binary and name it **extension** for linux use or **extension.exe** for windows use

And that's it. Now the app will execute the extension when it's called.
